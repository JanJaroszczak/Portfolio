## 1. Setup

- Check if you have node.js and npm installed. To do it, run this command in your terminal:

```npm
node -v
```

- If you don't have node, go to nodejs.org and install it on your local machine.

- Clone the project repository to your local machine.

- Check, if you have ‘node modules’ folder in your project structure. If you don't have it, run:

```npm
npm install
```

- Once you have ‘node modules’, run:

```npm
npm start
```

- The browser will automatically open the project on ‘localhost:3000’.
